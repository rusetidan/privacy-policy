<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our

<h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

The Service may display advertisements provided by third-party ad
networks. These ad networks may collect and use information such as
Advertising ID, IP address, device information, and app interaction
data to provide personalized ads.

Users may opt out of interest-based advertising in the application or through their device
settings (for example, limiting ad tracking on iOS or resetting the
Advertising ID on Android). Consent for data collection may be requested through in-app mechanisms where required by law.
</p>
